   # Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/n8n-backup-solution.git
   cd n8n-backup-solution
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment configuration
   cp .env.example .env.dev
   
   # Start development services

   # Make scripts executable
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   # Run the test suite
   ./run-tests.sh
   
   # Run specific test categories

## Style Guidelines

### Shell Script Guidelines

1. **Use bash shebang**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

2. **Enable strict mode**
   ```bash
   set -e  # Exit on error
   set -u  # Exit on undefined variable (optional)
   ```

3. **Use consistent formatting**
   ```bash
   # Good
   if [ "$variable" = "value" ]; then
       do_something
   fi
   
   # Bad
   if [$variable="value"]; then
   do_something
   fi
   ```

4. **Quote variables**
   ```bash
   # Good
   echo "Value: $variable"
   cp "$source" "$destination"
   
   # Bad
   echo Value: $variable
   cp $source $destination
   ```

5. **Use functions for repeated code**
   ```bash
   log() {
       echo -e "${GREEN}[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1${NC}"
   }
   
   error() {
       echo -e "${RED}[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] ERROR: $1${NC}"
       exit 1
   }
   ```

6. **Add comments for complex logic**
   ```bash
   # Create temporary directory with proper cleanup
   temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)
   trap 'rm -rf "$temp_dir"' EXIT
   ```

### Documentation Guidelines

1. **Use clear, concise language**
2. **Include code examples**
3. **Add screenshots for UI features**
4. **Update table of contents**
5. **Use proper markdown formatting**

### Error Handling

1. **Always handle errors gracefully**
   ```bash
   if ! some_command; then
       error "Command failed"
   fi
   ```

2. **Provide helpful error messages**
   ```bash
   error "Failed to connect to cloud storage. Check credentials in .env file"
   ```

3. **Clean up on failure**
   ```bash
   trap cleanup_on_error ERR
   ```
